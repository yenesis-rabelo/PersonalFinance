## Author's Info

+ Matthew McKinley
I started learning how to code in the summer of 2024, starting in Python. The classes that I've taken and the things that I've been taught have helped me know how to code Python pretty well and I've learned a lot of the logic of coding, and I can follow different languages. I think it's a good skill to be able to code, but I don't think I'm going to do this as a profession. You can reach me at my school email: matthew.mckinley@ucas-edu.net
